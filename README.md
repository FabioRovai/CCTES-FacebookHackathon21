# MANDARIN CHARACTER TRANSLATION WITH EMOJI AND SOUND


This project aims to create an interactive filter with an educational purpose. The idea is to use a small card, which can be used in any teaching environments, with a Chinese character on the top of it. When the front camera find the subject, the character 猫 (Māo) becomes a cat emoji, zooming in and out, and pronouncing the word in a loop, which can be activated/deactivate by tapping on the screen
